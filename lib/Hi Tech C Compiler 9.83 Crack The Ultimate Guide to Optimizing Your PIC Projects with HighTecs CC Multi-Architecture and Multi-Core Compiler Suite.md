In this article, we will review some of the features and benefits of this compiler, as well as some of the limitations and drawbacks. We will also compare it with the newer XC8 compiler from Microchip, which is the successor of the HI-TECH C Compiler.
 
## Features and Benefits
 
The HI-TECH C Compiler for PIC10/12/16 MCUs Version 9.83 offers several features and benefits for developers who want to program PIC microcontrollers in C. Some of these are:
 
- It is a free-standing compiler, which means it does not require any additional software or libraries to run.
- It is an optimizing compiler, which means it generates efficient and compact code that can fit in the limited memory and resources of PIC microcontrollers.
- It is an ANSI C compiler, which means it follows the standard C language syntax and semantics, making it easier to port code from other platforms or compilers.
- It supports a wide range of PIC microcontrollers, including some of the most popular and widely used ones.
- It has a user-friendly IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that integrates with MPLAB X IDE from Microchip, allowing you to edit, compile, debug and program your code in one environment.
- It has a comprehensive user manual that covers all aspects of the compiler's operation, as well as other useful information such as FAQs, forums and support.

## Limitations and Drawbacks
 
However, the HI-TECH C Compiler for PIC10/12/16 MCUs Version 9.83 also has some limitations and drawbacks that you should be aware of before using it. Some of these are:

- It is an old compiler that has not been maintained or updated since 2011[^1^]. This means it may have some bugs or issues that have not been fixed or addressed.
- It does not support some of the newer PIC microcontrollers that have been released after 2011, such as the PIC18FxxK42 series or the PIC16F188xx series.
- It does not support some of the advanced features or optimizations that are available in the newer XC8 compiler from Microchip, such as C99 support, inline assembly, code packing, data compression, function inlining, loop unrolling and more.
- It may generate code that is less efficient or compact than the code generated by the XC8 compiler, especially if you use the free Lite mode of the HI-TECH C Compiler. The Pro mode of the HI-TECH C Compiler requires a license fee to unlock more optimizations.
- It may not be compatible with some of the newer tools or libraries from Microchip or third-party vendors that are designed for the XC8 compiler.

## Comparison with XC8 Compiler
 
The XC8 compiler from Microchip is the successor of the HI-TECH C Compiler for PIC10/12/16 MCUs. It is based on the same code base as the HI-TECH C Compiler, but it has been improved and enhanced with new features and optimizations. The XC8 compiler supports all PIC10, PIC12 and PIC16 series devices, as well as many other PIC microcontrollers such as PIC18, PIC24 and dsPIC[^3^].
 
The XC8 compiler is also a free-standing, optimizing ANSI C compiler that integrates with MPLAB X IDE. However, it offers more options and flexibility than the HI-TECH C Compiler. For example, you can choose between different optimization levels (O0 to O3), different memory models (small to large), different standards (C90 to C99) and different extensions (XC8 or HI-TECH). You can also use inline assembly
