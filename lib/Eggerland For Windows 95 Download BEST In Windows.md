If you want to play Eggerland for Windows 95 on your PC, you will need a few things:
 
- A copy of the game. You can buy it online from sites like Amazon or eBay, or you can download it from some fan sites. However, be careful of viruses and malware when downloading from unofficial sources.
- A Windows 95 emulator. This is a program that simulates the Windows 95 operating system on your PC, allowing you to run old games and applications. There are several emulators available, such as DOSBox, VMware, VirtualBox, or PCem. You can download them from their official websites or from other sources.
- A CD-ROM drive or an ISO file. If you have a physical copy of the game, you will need a CD-ROM drive to insert the disc and run the game. If you have a digital copy of the game, you will need an ISO file, which is an image of the disc that can be mounted on your emulator.

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps:

1. Install and run your emulator of choice. You may need to configure some settings, such as memory, sound, video, and keyboard.
2. Mount your CD-ROM drive or ISO file on your emulator. This will make your emulator recognize the game disc as if it were inserted on your PC.
3. Run the setup.exe file on the game disc. This will install the game on your emulator's virtual hard drive.
4. Run the egger.exe file on the game folder. This will launch the game and let you play it.
