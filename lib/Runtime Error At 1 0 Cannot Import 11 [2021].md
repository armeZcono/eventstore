2. Look for an option called Programs and Features and click on it.
3. In the Programs and Features window, select the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages and click Uninstall. You will have to do this for each package.
4. In the uninstallation wizard window, click on Uninstall.
5. After you've uninstalled all the packages, open your web browser and go to the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable download page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0).
6. Here, click on the links under the Link section. It's recommended you download both the x86 and x64 versions of the package.

8. Reboot your computer.

This method will fix the runtime error if it was caused by an outdated version of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. Run the affected program to confirm this. If the error persists, move on to the next method.
 
## Method 2: Troubleshoot the Runtime Error Using Clean Boot
 
Sometimes, third-party programs or services can conflict with each other, resulting in a runtime error. To rule this out, you can clean boot your computer with all other third-party services disabled, except the one affected by the runtime error. While it may sound similar to Safe Mode, there are quite a few differences between clean boot and Windows Safe Mode. To clean boot your computer, do the following:

1. Press Windows Key + R to open the Run application.
2. Type msconfig in the text box and press Enter.
3. In the System Configuration windows, click on the Services tab.
4. Check the Hide all Microsoft Services box.
5. Click on Disable all.
6. Now, in the Services list, look for the affected application and enable it. If your application is not mentioned in the list, simply move on to the next step.
7. Click Apply and close the System Configuration window.
8. Press Windows Key + R again to open Run.
9. Type taskmgr in the text box and press Enter.
10. In Task Manager, click on Startup tab.
11. Right-click on each startup item and select Disable.
12. Close Task Manager and restart your computer.

Your computer will now boot with only essential services running. Try running your program again and see if the runtime error is gone. If it is, then you have successfully identified a conflicting service or program. You can now enable each service or program one by one until you find the culprit. Once you do, uninstall it or update
