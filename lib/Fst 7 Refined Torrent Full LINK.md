# Fst 7 Refined: A Bodybuilding DVD Featuring Jay Cutler, Phil Heath and Hany Rambod
 
Fst 7 Refined is a bodybuilding DVD that showcases the FST-7 training system developed by Hany Rambod, a renowned trainer and coach of many top pro bodybuilders. FST-7 stands for Fascia Stretch Training 7, which is a method of stretching the muscle fascia (the connective tissue that surrounds the muscle fibers) by performing 7 sets of high-rep exercises at the end of a workout. This is supposed to increase blood flow, nutrient delivery, muscle growth and recovery.
 
The DVD features four-time Mr. Olympia Jay Cutler, two-time Mr. Olympia Phil Heath and NPC competitor Tamer El-Guindy as they demonstrate various FST-7 workouts for different body parts. The DVD also includes interviews with the athletes and Rambod, as well as tips and advice on nutrition, supplementation, posing and contest preparation.

FST-7 Training Benefits
 
So what are the benefits of FST-7 training? According to Rambod and his clients, FST-7 can help you achieve several goals, such as:
 
- Increasing muscle size and fullness by creating more space for muscle growth
- Improving muscle definition and separation by enhancing vascularity and blood flow
- Enhancing muscle recovery and repair by delivering more nutrients and oxygen to the muscles
- Boosting muscle strength and endurance by stimulating more muscle fibers and increasing metabolic stress
- Optimizing hormonal output of testosterone and human growth hormone by creating an anabolic environment in the body

FST-7 is a great add-on to split routines and can really help trigger additional muscle growth within certain muscle groups. FST-7 can be used on practically any muscle group and can be even more effective when used on lagging body parts[^4^].
  
FST-7 Training Tips
 
To get the most out of FST-7 training, you need to follow some guidelines and tips. Here are some of them:

- Choose an isolation exercise for the FST-7 sets, such as cable crossovers for chest, leg extensions for quads, or dumbbell curls for biceps. This will allow you to focus on the target muscle and minimize the involvement of other muscles.
- Use a weight that allows you to reach failure at 10-12 reps for the first set. Then, try to maintain the same weight and reps for the remaining sets. If you can't, reduce the weight slightly or increase the rest periods to 45 seconds.
- Keep your form strict and controlled. Don't use momentum or cheat reps. Focus on squeezing and contracting the muscle at the peak of each rep.
- Drink plenty of water during your workout to stay hydrated and enhance the pump. You can also use a pre-workout supplement that contains ingredients that boost nitric oxide production, such as citrulline malate, arginine, or beetroot juice.
- Stretch the target muscle after each FST-7 set for 10-15 seconds. This will help to further expand the fascia and increase blood flow to the muscle[^1^].
