Gta San Andreas is one of the most popular games in the Grand Theft Auto series, but it also shows its age with outdated graphics and low-resolution textures. If you want to enjoy this classic game with a modern look, you can install some of the best graphics mods available for free. Here are some of the best ones you can try.
 
- **Real HD Graphics**: This mod is a global reconfiguration of all effects, textures and shaders, making the game look more realistic and detailed. It features new bump mapping for water and puddles, new DoF, corrected lighting and reflections, new bloom, new rain, stars, moon and noise textures, SweetFX for better smoothing and vignetting[^1^].
- **Insanity Vegetation**: This mod improves the look of all plants in the game, making them more luscious and vibrant. It replaces the low-quality textures with high-resolution ones that make Los Santos feel more alive[^2^].
- **Memory Update for San Andreas**: This mod allows the game to use more memory, which increases the drawing distance and the number of loadable objects. This makes the world feel bigger and reduces pop-in issues[^2^].
- **Cloud Skybox for GTA San Andreas**: This mod replaces the plain sky with a realistic one featuring clouds. It adds more depth and atmosphere to the game, especially when flying[^2^].

To install these mods, you will need some tools like CLEO, ASI Loader, Mod Loader and ENB Series. You can find them online or in some mod packs. You will also need to backup your game files before installing any mod, in case something goes wrong or you want to revert to the original version. To install a mod, you usually need to copy and paste some files into your game folder or use a mod manager. You can find detailed instructions on each mod's page or video[^3^] [^4^].
